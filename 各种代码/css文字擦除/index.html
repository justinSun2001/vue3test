            BEFORE HUGH Herr became a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), he was a promising
            rock climber. But after being trapped in a blizzard during a climb at age 17, he lost both his legs below
            the knee to frostbite. Since then he has worked on creating prosthetic legs that would work and feel like
            the real thing. He appears to have succeeded.

            In an article published on July 1st in Nature Medicine, Dr Herr and his team at MIT describe seven people
            with below-the-knee amputations who can now walk normally with the help of surgery and new robotic
            prostheses. For the first time, Dr Herr says, people have been able to walk with bionic legs—mechanical
            prostheses that mimic their biological counterparts—that can be fully controlled by their brains.
